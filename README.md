# Project 7: Flower Shop
Challenge: Design a user-friendly, desktop-style web application for a local flower shop to manage inventory, process orders, and track customer information—all within a single-page experience.

Context: I developed a React-based Single Page Application (SPA) that simulates a desktop program using multiple views and a clean navigation structure. The application allows staff to manage flowers, 
customer data, and orders seamlessly without page reloads. Emphasis was placed on data integrity and a responsive user interface using JavaScript for logic and validation.

Action: I built modular views using HTML, CSS, and React components. I applied object-oriented principles to define Flower, Customer, and Order classes. I used JavaScript arrays (analogous to Java’s ArrayLists) 
to dynamically store and manage flower inventory and order records. The application supports adding, editing, and deleting inventory items, placing new orders, and calculating total costs at checkout. 

Results: One of the biggest challenges was making sure the inventory stayed accurate as new orders were placed. Once I set up the right methods and added input validation, the app worked smoothly and kept everything in sync.

Reflection: This project helped me practice important programming skills like working with classes, objects, file saving/loading, and handling errors. It also gave me a better understanding of 
how a simple point-of-sale system can be built and used in a real-world setting.
