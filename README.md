# Project 7: Flower Shop
Challenge: Design a web application for a flower shop.

Context: I developed a Java application to help a flower shop manage its products, orders, and customer information. The focus was on building a desktop-style program using object-oriented programming and Java collections.

Action: I created Java classes for Flower, Customer, and Order. I used ArrayLists to store and manage orders and inventory. The program allowed adding, editing, and deleting flowers, placing new orders, and calculating total costs. I used basic file handling to save and load order data.

Results: The biggest challenge was managing data relationships and keeping inventory updated with each new order. Once I implemented proper methods and data validation, everything ran smoothly.

Refelction: This project helped me apply core Java concepts like classes, objects, file I/O, and exception handling in a real-world scenario. It gave me a better understanding of how a simple POS (Point of Sale) system could be built from scratch.
